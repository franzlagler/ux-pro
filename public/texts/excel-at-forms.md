# Excel at making forms

I’m still amazed by the fact how many forms there are on the web that are the very antithesis of user-friendly. For it really isn’t rocket science to create forms that your users will love to use. In the following, I will provide you with five handy tips that if applied will make all of your forms both look visually appealing as well as easy to understand.

## Tell your form's purpose

If you don't tell your users why they should share their date with you, they will most likely not do it. As a result, you should always provide them with a short description of why their data is needed and especially what benefit they derive from doing it.

## Placeholders are not labels

Using placeholders as labels is unfortunately still a thing. But you really, really shouldn't do. Mainly for the following two reasons: On the one hand, placeholder labels are not ready by screen readers. As a result, people who use such software won't know at all what kind of data they should type into a field. On the other hand, you need to consider that placeholder text disappears as soon as you start typing. Your users would therefore need to keep in mind all of your fields and their exact order. Let's be honest. That's no what a user-friendly form should be like.

## Don't let them guess

There shouldn't be any field in your form that doesn't explicitly tell what kind of data it expects. In order to ensure that, first and foremost provide a meaningful label for every single field. If you have a text field, you should also specify the expected format of the input. This can be achieved through a placeholder or preferably by simply adding this information to your label. What's more always try to think of what field type seems most logical for its purpose. For a name field it is quite obvious that a text field would be best. When it comes to something like gender, however, a selection field with radio buttons seems the much better choice.

## Group your form fields

When you have a greater number of fields in your form, it is considered best practice to split your form into different sections. That is, you should group form fields that are semantically similar - e.g. payment details - and give each group an adequate heading. As a result, your users will have a much easier time navigating through your form and understanding what each of your fields exactly relates to.

## Provide good error messages

Good error messages in forms are characterized by several aspects: First of all, they are given instantly. That is, whenever a user provides wrong data in a field, you should immediately notify them. Secondly, good error messages state clearly which field they are referring to. The best way to do that is by writing the message right next to the respective field. Thirdly, they tell the user exactly what is wrong with their provided input. Don't just display generic statements 'Error occurred!'. Rather give a detailed description of what is wrong and what they should change.
