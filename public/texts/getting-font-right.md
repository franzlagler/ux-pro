# Typography in a nutshell

The way text is being presented to us in an application has a great impact on how we perceive the respective application. It significantly determines whether we would consider an application interesting or trustworthy. A good understanding of typography is therefore a must. As a start, take a look at the following five tips.

## No flat hierachies

You should definitely aim for a clear hierarchical structure. That is, you should make each of your text elements distinct that every user will immediately know whether the element they are currently looking at is, for example, a heading or a normal paragraph. The easiest way to achieve this is by using different font sizes as well as font weights: The primary heading should always be bigger and usually also bolder than for example a secondary heading or a paragraph element.

## Serif versus Sans-Serif Fonts

Maybe you have heard about this rule whether to choose a serif or a sans-serif font. If you want something to look professional and elegant, you should go for the first font type. If you, on the other hand, want something to look modern and friendly, you would go for the latter. While this rule is for sure not totally wrong, you shouldn't take it too seriously either. Yes, serif fonts are usually associated with professionality. That doesn't mean, however, that a website that uses a sans-serif font would necessarily be considered unprofessional. In the end, it's the overall impression that matters: Do your fonts match the general theme of your application? Are your fonts readable on different screens? These are the questions you should focus on.

## Text Sizing

Another really import topic of typography is the general size of your text. The general rule in this regard goes as follows: The bigger the screen of your device, the larger your font should be. Make sure, however, to not use any font sizes below 16px. Otherwise, some of your users might have a really hard time reading your text. And that's definitely not what you want to go for as a developer who cares about accessiblity.

## Text Alignment

Almost everybody of us has already visited a website with bad text alignment. It makes the website look unprofessional and what is even worse it makes your text be significantly less legible to your users. As a result, you should definitely check your text alignments before you publish your project: Paragraphs with longer text are usually left-aligned or right-aligned depending on which language is being used. Text with only a few words, in contrast, works better with centered alignment. Justified text elements, no matter their purpose, should definitely be avoided. They mess up the space between your words which reduces legibility by a lot.

## Line Spacing

When it comes to line spacing, you should stick to the following guidelines: In order to ensure good readibility and accessiblity, the general line spacing should be between around 140% and 180%. That being said, small fonts might require even more spacing than that. Moreover, you should limit the line length to 70-80 characters. Longer as well as shorter lines will usually result in poorer legibility.
