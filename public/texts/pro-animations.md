# Animate like a pro

Animations have become an essential part of all sorts of applications. That's why it's really import to have a good knowledge about how to create animations so that all your users can enjoy your animations. Or at least not be disturbed by them.

## Animations should be used wisely

One common mistake is to make an animation just for the sake of having an animation. Animation should always have a purpose. They should draw a user's attention to a certain aspect or provide useful information to them. A progress bar, for example, that indicates that some content take longer to load would meet this expectation.

## Make your animations accessible

Accessibility is not a feature but a requirement. That's why its essential to consider some accessiblity guidelines when creating animations: Try to avoid animations that include some sort flashing. They are not just not very nice too look at but they are also a potential threat for people with epilepsy. If you have some animated videos, always think of providing a pause button for your users. That way you give your users the chance to turn them off if they feel for whatever reason irritated by them.

## Avoid linear animations for motion

Linear motion is quite easy to understand. Something moves linearly when it constantly covers the same distance per unit of time. In other words, if you move a constant speed, you move linearly. While linear motion might be easy to understand, it also comes with a downside: It doesn't look natural to our eyes at all. That is because in reality we don't really ever perceive linear actions. Neither ourselves, nor our surroundings move continuously at the same speed. Two popular, less artifical alternatives for linear motion are ease-in and ease-out. Ease-in refers to any sort of motion with a slow starting speed that then gradually increases until it reaches a certain peak. It is recommended to use that sort of animation for any objects that fly out of the screen. Ease-out, on the other hand, refers to the opposite kind of motion that starts off quickly and towards the end gets continuously slower. This sort of animation should be used if an object emerges on the screen such as an incoming message.

## How fast is good?

To make on thing clear in advance: There is no such thing as the perfect animation speed. Animations and their purpose simply differ too much to have one specific standard that would work for all cases. There are some general recommendations, however, that all of you can keep in mind when thinking of how long your duration should be: First of all, the bigger the screen of a device is, the longer the animation should usually take. The reason for this is easy to grasp: On a bigger screen, an animated element has to cover a longer distance. Secondly, bigger elements should move slower than smaller ones as they move faster.
